$\sigma =$ *alphabet* that denote a finite set of *symbols*
$\epsilon =$ *empty* tuple (with n = 0 elements)

$\sigma ^{0} = \epsilong$
$\sigma ^{n} = \sigma^{n-1} \dot \sigma$
 
$\sigma ^{\star} =$ the closure of all *finite*  set of 
strings on the alphabet $\sigma$]

$|\sigma^{n}| = |\sigma|^{n}$

*decision problem examples*
- given a natural number *n*, is *n* prime?
- given a graph, what is the maximum degree of its nodes?
- from a customer database, select the customers that are more than fifty yearso old.
- given a set of pieces of furniture and a set of trucks, can we accommodate all the furniture in the trucks?

**Computable** if and only if a procedure can be described to compute the function's outcome in a finite number of steps.
