Interaction Design: beyond human-computer interaction

###Group project.

#Group report containing a link to a mid-fidelity prototype (70%)
#Individual evaluation of the artefact and the design process (30%).

##Topic.
Sustainable mobility refers to the use of either non-polluting travel methods (e.g., walking or cycling), collective travel methods (e.g., bus, train, or car-pooling) or low-pollution travel means (e.g., electrical cars).

The goal of this project is to design a mid-fidelity prototype of a system that would encourage people to increase their use of sustainable mobility options.

Possible methods include resorting to game mechanics (gamification) or using a persuasive technology approach.


##Procedure.
The project will be organised around Requirements elicitation, Design and Evaluation.

# Analysis of existing products: 
the students will collect and analyse examples of interactive devices aimed to facilitate sustainable mobility. These examples will be evaluated by an analytic procedure and used to create a design library (2 weeks).
# Ideation: 
based on result of step 1 the group will engage in a number of ideas generation and brainstorming section to identify the space of the design they want to address. This phase will give rise to initial design directions which will then be iteratively tested and modified during the project (1 week)
#PACT ANALYSIS. 
Each group will identify stakeholders, context of use, and the set of activities they wish to support with their project, broadly defining the interaction technology required. Once the stakeholders have been identified, each user member will conduct 5 contextual interviews following a methodology defined by the group to elicit user requirements. It is recommended that the interviews be recorded. Notes from the interviews will be prepared by each student and collectively analysed using affinity analysis. The analysis of the context and activities will also be supported by observation (supported by videos and pictures whenever possible) and task analysis (2 weeks).
#Design phase. 
Each person will implement different prototypes of the framework emerging from the PACT analysis producing scenarios, personas, and story board etc. The group will consolidate and internally evaluate the different proposals consolidating a smaller set of alternatives.
#Evaluation phase. 
Each student will evaluate selected design in user testing with at least 5 participants. Data will be analysed by the group.
#Phase III and IV 
are to be iterated at least twice (time for entire design iteration 6 weeks).
#Report writing. 
The group will produce a 10 pages (max) report of the project and a prototype of the service. Report writing is both an individual and a group activity. All members are expected to contribute but it will be marked as a group deliverable not as a collection of chapters (2 weeks). The report is composed of:
	Executive summary (1 page).
	Analysis of existing products and ideas generation.
	PACT analysis (rich description of requirements with implications for design).
	Design methodology.
	Prototype description (justification of main design choices).
	Evaluation Results (final user study).
	Conclusion.


##Help and contact information.
The work will be carried out independently by the students. However, special sessions will be held in the class, to discuss and review the work. It is of utmost importance to the success of the project that each member of the group contributes to the work. In case of problems and conflicts which students are unable to deal with independently, they are invited to contact Prof. De Angeli.
People who do NOT contribute to the group work will receive a lower mark (up to 0 in case of no contribution at all).

##Marking scheme.
Presentation (10%).
Validity and reliability of user testing (30%).
Analysis of results (30%).
Quality of design (20%).
Suggestions for future work (10%).




###good shit to write

change the process, change the outcome
at first we looked at pokemon go as professor said to us,
it worked extremely good, it had a strong impact on people and 
that's what we wanted for out app
so we looked at every feature.
You have to walk to open the eggs --> you have to walk to earn point
you have to play to become more powerful --> you have to play to earn more point
you have friends to play with in the raid --> you have friends, wich would share the same transport

EXTRA point if you shut the phone screen down during the whole trip.

its a product that can be used everyday and will empower the mental reward 
for someone who moves sostenibile.

to create an experience to share with your friends and the new people u will meet.
(works as tinder, if people do the same street for some time a notification will appear)

looking on the playstore for the keyword of the project we find some interesting idea
that could have been integrated togheter or restructured.
